## üõ†Ô∏è Manufacturing

To order PCBs:

1. Use the **Gerber files** in `/hardware`.  
2. Upload to a PCB manufacturer (e.g., JLCPCB, PCBWay, OSH Park).  
3. Provide BOM to source components.  
4. Assemble manually or via pick-and-place.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Design Notes

- This design uses a **virtual ground electrode** implementation.  
  No physical ground electrode is required for operation, as the ADS1294 reference (RLD) is internally stabilized.  
  This simplifies assembly and makes the device more wearable.  

---

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. **Assemble the board** following the BOM.  
2. **Program the ATmega1284P** using ISP or bootloader (Arduino-compatible toolchains supported).  
3. **Power via Li-Ion battery or micro-USB**.  
4. **Connect via Bluetooth** to stream biosignals.
